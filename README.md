## Forecasting Traffic Flow in US Metropolis

For the March edition of the 2022 Tabular Playground Series you're challenged to forecast twelve-hours of traffic flow in a U.S. metropolis. The time series in this dataset are labelled with both location coordinates and a direction of travel -- a combination of features that will test your skill at spatio-temporal forecasting within a highly dynamic traffic network.
